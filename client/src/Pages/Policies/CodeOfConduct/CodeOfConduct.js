          <h3> Serialized is a Community </h3>
          <p>
            Serialized is a community as much as it is a place to post stories,
            as such all Users are expected to act in such a way that does not
            worsen another User’s experience.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3> Serialized values Diversity and Inclusion </h3>
          <p>
            Serialized is a community that accepts and stands behind people with
            disabilities or particular needs, people of color, people of all
            sexual orientations, gender identities, and so on. As a community,
            we do not tolerate activity directly or indirectly threatens the
            safety of or discriminates against other Users.
          </p>
          <h3> What NOT to Post</h3>
          <p>
            We try to leave creativity up to you, but there are some things we
            ask that users not post:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not post content you do not own. </li>
            <li>
              Do not post content whose purpose is to harass, mock, or
              intimidate other Users on any basis, but especially: race, gender
              identity, religion, sexual orientation, or heritage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not post content that glorifies hate groups, hateful
              ideologies, or hate movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not post content that includes identifying information about
              any User, even if such information is publicly available.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Short Version </h3>
          <p>
            Serialized is community for you to read stories and post ones you’ve
            written, as long as you’re not a jerk.
          </p>
        </section>
      </main>
